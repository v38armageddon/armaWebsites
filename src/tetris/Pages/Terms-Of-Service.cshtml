            In the utilization of our projects/services, v38armageddon offers a choice among five types of licenses:
            <ol>
                <li>EUPL</li>
                <li>GPL-3</li>
                <li>MS-PL</li>
                <li>The Unlicense</li>
                <li>Prorietary</li>
            </ol>
            Most of our projects/services are governed by Open-Source Licenses. However, in specific cases where a Proprietary License is deemed necessary, v38armageddon reserves the flexibility to apply it.
            <br /><br />
            The user is encouraging to explore more information about each license, accessible through their respective content.
            <br /><br />
            Note:
            For projects/services under Proprietary Licenses, the details of the license are included with the project/service. The user is encouraging to review and comply with the specified license terms.
            <br /><br />
            As of 2024-08-31, we’ve starting to replace all GPL-3 licenses to EUPL (European Union Public Licence), all projects that have existing GPL-3 licenses will both work to comply with GPL-3 license. All new big projects will have by default the EUPL licenses. We support both licenses for the big projects.

            At v38armageddon, our primary emphasis is on Open Source utilization, and we utilize GitHub as our primary platform for hosting code repositories. If it becomes necessary to create a project as Proprietary, v38armageddon reserves the absolute right to refrain from hosting the source code on GitHub. It is essential to note that once a project is Open Source, it cannot transition to being Proprietary, but a Proprietary project may be subsequently released as Open Source.
